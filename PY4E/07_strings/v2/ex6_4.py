# There is a string method calles __count__ that is similar to the function in the previous exercise. Read the documentation of this method at:
# https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
# Write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in 'banana'.

word = 'banana'
x = word.count('a')
print(x) # 3 -> the number of times that letter 'a' appears in the word 'banana'
