[Lecture](https://www.py4e.com/html3/03-conditional)

In this section we talked about:
- Comparison operators (==  <=  >= < > !=)
- Indentation
- One-way decisions
- Two-way decisions (__if:__ and __else:__)
- Nested decisions
- Multi-way decisions using __elif__
- __try__ / __except__ to compensate for errors
