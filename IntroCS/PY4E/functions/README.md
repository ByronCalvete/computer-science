# Functions

[Lecture](https://www.py4e.com/html3/04-functions)

### T function or not to function...

- Organize your code into "paragraphs" - capture a complete thought and "name it"
- Don't repeat yourself - make it work once and the reuse it
- If something gets too long or complex, break it up into logical chunks and put those chunks in functions
- Make a library of common stuff that you do over and over

In this section we talked about:
- Arguments
- Results (fruitful functions)
- Void (non-fruitful) functions
- Why use functions?
- Functions
- Built-In functions - Type conversion (int, float), String conversions
- Parameters
